# The Unseen Force Behind AI Innovation: The Power of Open Source

AI is all over the spotlight nowdays and deep leanring models are showing incredible capabilities (Though Ai inteligence is still very far from human inteligence, but arguably nobody would have bet on such breakthorugh ten years ago) . Whereas it is fair to say that this is the result of decades of research, the impact of open source software on AI innovation is often undervalued, with credit often given solely to researchers. The engineers behind Pytorch have contributed just as much to AI innovation as the researchers at top universities. 

Open source software is usually persee as 

If you believe that tech giants invest in open source like law firm take care of pro bono case then looking at the impact of open source on AI will help you understand why open source is a catalyzer for innovation.


## AI latest sucess is about engineering

Most of the idea used in today ai where coined decades ago
it is all about scale of compute and data

## Early call for open access and open source 

## A world without open source in AI

##  The probable end of Open Source weights access
